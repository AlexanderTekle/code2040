API Challenge CODE2040


Things to do...

1. Write extensive test cases.
2. Write fleshed out comments
3. Try to see what methods i can abstract into their own file, kind of like
4. placedata(info, info). That way I do have repetitive code. Also getting the dictionaries from the API
5. Think of some random edge cases
6. Looks like I dont need to import JSON
7. Make sure the way I import requests is "clean"
8. I have my_json twice in different functions.... while that does
work becayse tget are in two different scopes, it may confuse someone reading my code
9. Maybe I dont need to save uncessary variables?
